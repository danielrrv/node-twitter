# node-twitter


Hello. This a small Nodejs application fine-grained implemented from the scratch.

# How to run.
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` - reloading versions.
3. `npm start` - as default starter.
4. `npm run test` run tests.
	- Time's valuable, therefore I only run the tests that I had time time to do.


## Docker.
Option 1: Build the image and run the container.
Option 2: Use Docker-compose to build and run the image.
